# artificien_tutorials

## Code Details

This repo contains a single jupyter notebook with a simple linear regression model prewritten. Once the tutorial is complete, the linear regression model is sent to our backend services and made available for download and training by client devices. To simply view the tutorial walkthrough, open the jupyter notebook [on github](./tutorials/health-tutorial.ipynb). To actually run the tutorial, navigate to [JupyterhHub](https://jupyter.artificien.com) and log in with your Artificien account. Then head to the `tutorials` directory, open up the `health-tutorial`, and run the cells in order.

## Execution

In order to complete the tutorial, simply run all cells in order, making sure to fill in required fields (such as your artificien.com password) as you go. You will recieve a json response with a "success" message if the model has been stored properly on our backend services. Additional details are explained in the notebook itself.

## Example

By the time you reach the last few cells in the tutorial, your notebook should look like [this](tutorial_sc_example.png)
