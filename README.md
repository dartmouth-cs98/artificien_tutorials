## Code Details

This repo contains a single jupyter notebook with a simple linear regression model prewritten. Once the tutorial is complete, the linear regression model is sent to our backend services and made available for download and training by client devices. To simply view the tutorial walkthrough, simply open the jupyter notebook [on github](./tutorials/health-tutorial.ipynb). To run the tutorial, navigate to [JupyterhHub](jupyter.artificien.com), log in with your Artificien account, and run the cells in order.

## Execution

In order to execute the model, simply run all cells in order. You will recieve a json response with a "success" message if the model has been stored properly on our node. Additional details are explained in the notebook itself.

## Example

By the time you reach the last few cells in the tutorial, your notebook should appear like [this](tutorial_sc_example.png)
