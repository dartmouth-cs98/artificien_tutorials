    "# Artificien Sample Model Upload\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate how to create a machine learning model and upload it so that it may be trained on client devices using federated learning.\n",
    "We create a simple linear regression model below, defined in PyTorch syntax, to predict a single variable 'Y' using another three input variables, which are stored in the vector 'X'. We then upload the model to a backend service that we call a 'node'. Models sent to this node will be downloaded by client devices (iPhones, Androids, etc.) and trained on local user data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a device or set of devices trains your model, the model stored on the node will be updated to reflect the newly improved model. In our case, we train a linear regression model (a very simple machine learning model) to take in the data `Age`, `Sex` and `Body Mass Index` to predict a user's `Weekly Step Count`. Once we upload your model, then users of the Artificien Health app can download and train your model on their **real live Apple Health data**, where your model will learn how to utilize the three input variables (`Age`, `Sex` and `Body Mass Index`) to predict the output variable (`Weekly Step Count`). \n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you upload the below tutorial model, you'll find it on [artificien.com](https://artificien.com) on your 'models' page. There, you'll be able to check the model progress and download the newly trained model once training is complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cycles, Accuracy, and Model Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uploaded in this tutorial, for the sake of this demonstration, is configured to train on at minimum 1 device per \"training cycle\" and at maximum 4 devices per training cycle. If more than 1 device but fewer than 4 devices have trained your model within 1 hour, this cycle will be marked complete. Likewise, *as soon as* 4 devices have trained your model, the cycle is complete. In total, this model will train for 4 cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "As your model trains, devices training the model will send 'updates' to our backend servers indicating how the model should be improved. Once a cycle completes, we average up all of the 'updates' that devices that trained your model sent, and create a new-and-improved model, which incorporates the learnings your model obtained while training on the device data. Then, when another cycle commences, devices will download this new-and-improved model and send information to us on how we can improve *that* model even further as well. This process, where we iteratively update the model at the end of each cycle, continues until we reach `num_cycles`. As your model trains, you'll see its average loss (in this case, the number of steps by which it misses the mark when trying to predict someone's step count) update, and you'll see that its progress % goes up over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the machine learning engineers out there - think of `num_cycles` as analagous to `num_epochs`, and min/ max `num_devices` as analagous to `batch_size`. In standard ML, models are updated at end of an epoch, after training on `batch_size` samples. In federated ML, model parameters are updated at the end of a cycle, after training on `num_devices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for a real machine learning model, you'd certainly want to train on a lot more than 1-4 devices per cycle, and you might want to have more than 4 cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Please Read: \n",
    "- You cannot save changes made to this tutorial - this file is shared by all Artificien users and cannot be altered. To create your own notebooks (which can be edited and saved), create a new notebook in your root ('/') directory, or make a copy of this notebook and place it in your root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To build models for deployment to actual devices running Artificien partner apps, ensure that your model can train on and make predictions using the provided [sample dataset](../sample_data) corresponding to the type of data you'd like to build on top of. For this tutorial, we ensure that the model indeed works on the health app data before sending it."

In a real world scenario, you'd likely want a much larger batch size (`num_devices`) and epoch count (`num_cycles`) in order for your model to improve substantially. Nevertheless, we've shown some improvement here, reaching an average weekly step count error of around 25K, and it is clear that the model has begun to determine how the input data predicts the output label (step count). Below, we print the average step count error we obtained, and a 'baseline' metric, which is the average error you would obtain if you were to simply guess that all individuals had the *average* step count."
